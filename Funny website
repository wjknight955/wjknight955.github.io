    <h1>Silk Moths by Tim</h1>
    <p>Silk moths are the only declared domesticated insect. They rely on humans for exiting their cocoons and reproduction. These moths were used in the time of the Silk Road to create silk, a luxury product. It is somewhat used today. It is crucial that these moths are preserved and maintained carefully due to their reliance on humans.</p>
